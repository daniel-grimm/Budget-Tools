Design Ideas
Create a Build File which will automatically increment the version number of the system.
Alternatively, get Jenkins or Maven or some build system working that will update it for me.

Add a gui that displays the information graphically and allows the user to edit the values in
the text file.

Change the BIOS file to generate output but not display the output.
